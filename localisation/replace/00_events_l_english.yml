nti_events.1.d:0 "It has been 2 months since I and all of the men were ordered to join the Antiochian army and to fight the so called mystic and fanatic Hashashins. I wish the best for all of our children and our family members and give them my blessing. I guarantee you that everything is going fine until now thankfully.  Until now it has been twenty-three weeks since we had prepared and advanced from Antioch. I am currently leading a small regiment. All of the warriors here are good men,zealous to spread the word of Christ. Shall God defend this christian knights from the Infidel Menace. When we arrived in Homs,we met with a small Hashashin Army. We were told that they were fierce warriors but we instead met some muslim warbands who were pillaging the countryside. The battle began slowly and could be said to be a preparation of what to come. After a few skirmishes, the warbands retreated cowardly like women and left all of their loot behind.However we were not after the loot but after the fortress built by the Hashashins.This mighty fortress has been one of the few last Muslim bastions and is revered by the Hashashins greatly. In that place we met fierce resistance. I have not seen a fortress so gigantic in my life. Everyday,when we approached,the sky would turn black from the immense amount of arrows that would be fired upon. The fightings would continue every day and even in their walls. After numerous battles,that we all have fought bravely the muslims have begun to be pushed back. Even though the battles that we have won,we have lost a lot of our brothers,which now their spirits must have gone to heaven to say the last goodbye. With the help of the god we have until now endured the biggest difficulties that you could imagine. Starvation,Epidemics and more. The supplies have begun to become scarce in this holy expedition. A lot of our knights would have starved to death unless we wouldn't have helped them with everything that we had. We have endured and sacrificed everything for our lord and now we are currently trying to endure more the storms of rain of Syria. Those who say  that the heat is the harshest condition of this region are wrong because the storms here are similiar to the storms of the west. Until now the carnage and deathtoll is unimaginable for the both sides but however we can see now a piece of light and hope. Rumours of a vision sent by god has started to boost the morale of our soldiers, and more reinforcements have started to come help us. As for hashashins,fought hard and valiantly they did. God be with us and guide us in this holy struggle."
