  RISE_OF_THE_OTTOMANS_DESC:0 "Encouraged by the conquest of Mesopotamia in the eleventh crusade the pope declared the twelfth crusade to take mecca and once and for all crush Islam. The Twelfth crusade would prove an abject failure as the crusader armies were whittled down by Arab and would see the collapse of Crusader authority in the near east. In Rhomania their long era of civil wars had finally ended, and they stood united behind one emperor. In the west French royal authority collapsed, its rebellious dukes breaking away from their de jure king and the Black Duke of Aquitaine even claiming the title of king for himself."
